        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Having moved to Australia 4 years ago I am looking for employment where I can transfer and use my organisational skills and my passion for working with people. I am a qualified Physical Education teacher from Syria but also have experience as a secretary /administration officer from UAE and customer service here in Australia so am very organised and punctual. I am bilingual in Arabic and English and have a positive bubbly personality. I am willing to take on a variety of roles.</p>
